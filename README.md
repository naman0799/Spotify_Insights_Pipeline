# Spotify Playlist ETL & Analytics Project #

A real-world inspired data engineering and analytics project that extracts Spotify playlist data, transforms it into a structured format, loads it into SQL Server, and visualises insights in Power BI.

> This project demonstrates an end-to-end ETL workflow â€” from data extraction via Spotify API â†’ transformation using Python â†’ loading into SQL Server â†’ visualisation in Power BI.

## Workflow

1. Extract (Python)
  *  Retrieved Spotify playlist data using Spotify Web API (via spotipy library).
  *  Collected metadata such as:
      - Track ID, Track Name, Artist
      - Album, Popularity, Duration
      - Release Date

2. Transform (Python)

 *  Cleaned and structured the extracted data.
 *  Converted timestamps into proper date formats.
 *  Handled duplicates and null values.
 *  Exported the processed data into CSV files for database loading.

3. Load (SQL - Microsoft SQL Server)

* Created a SQL table schema and inserted transformed data.
* Sample Data Cleaning & Updates.
* Alter column type for consistency


4. Analysis (SQL Queries)

* Some key queries used for insights:

```
-- Most Frequent Artists in Trending List
    SELECT artist, COUNT(*) AS total_songs
    FROM spotify_tracks
    GROUP BY artist
    ORDER BY total_songs DESC;
```

```
-- Distribution of Tracks by Release Year
    SELECT YEAR(release_date) AS release_year, COUNT(*) AS total_tracks
    FROM spotify_tracks
    GROUP BY YEAR(release_date)
    ORDER BY release_year DESC;
```

5. Visualise (Power BI)

* Built an interactive dashboard with:

   * KPIs: Total Tracks, Distinct Artists, Most Popular Song

* Charts:

  * Popularity distribution across songs
  * Most frequent artists in the dataset
  * Release year distribution

* Filters/Slicers: By artist, year, and popularity range
